# Cake-Frontend
React Frontend for a Cake Ordering API
# Notes
there should be two different portals, one for customers and one for bakeries.

for customers, there would ideally be only three tabs, new orders, current orders, completed orders

for bakeries, maybe a week/month calender that logs and tracks orders, perhaps sends reminders? allows bakers to pass along updates to orders, maybe something like Dominos tracker
